# Paginator - discord_components
This repository is just an example code for how to carry out pagination using the discord_components library for python. Its fairly easy, and once you get the hang of it you can modify it as per your choice :D

## Pre Requisites
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Python 3.7+ installed on your computer
- Discord Account

## Libraries
Simply install these by running `pip install <library name>` in your terminal
- discord.py
- asyncio
- discord_components

## Usage
1. Download the pagination.py file
2. Replace `<TOKEN>` with your bot's token
3. Edit the embeds as necessary / add more
4. Edit button styles if necessary
5. Run it!

## More To Know
- Adding checks to the `wait_for` statement will allow you to restrict buttons usage for a single user
- If you're gonna be using this in a case where multiple people might be using it at the same time, consider putting a check to get the message id == mainMessage.id
